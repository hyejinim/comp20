        <h2>About the GIPHY API</h2>
        <p>GIPHY is the first and largest GIF search engine. Anyone can access to GIPHY's content library
           of GIFs and Stickers. The GIPHY API is a series of JSON read endpoints that allow you to integrate 
           the features of GIPHY's search engine into your project or app. 
           I used GIPHY API to display GIF images. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Link</h2>
        <p>GIPHY website: <a href="https://giphy.com/">https://giphy.com/</a></p>
        <p>GIPHY API: <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide">https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide</a></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Options for the API Request</h2>
        <p>Word is used as a parameter to the API call. I set "tada" as a default word as you can see when page is loaded. 
           When user enters a word or phrase in the input field and hit the Generate button, the GIPHY search engine finds GIFs with the word as a search query.</p>
           <br>
           <h2>Applications Ideas</h2>
        <p>1. Social Media, Messanger, or Email: <br>
            GIFs can be used in communicating context. Users can easily express themselves and animate their emotion and conversations with GIFs
            when they communicate with others. It would be great if a keyword is automatically extracted in text and an application recommends GIFs for it.
        </p>
        <p>2. New Tab Extension for Chrome: <br>
            When user opens a new tab, random or trending GIFs are displayed. It will transform a boring “new tab” page into a fun one. 
            It might be better than a search-box-filled screen. We can also use data from other APIs such as weather or
            news media for a parameter (search query). Users then can be provided context-related GIFs.
